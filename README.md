# scikit-learn-open-source-project

In this 7 person team, we worked the machine learning library [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Specifically, we
- Wrote [design documents](architecture/) for the library
- Created [class diagrams](class-diagrams/) for the library
- Worked on and fixed [issues](github-issue-summary/)
